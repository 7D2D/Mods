Lots of cool junk items for your junk loot that I created while working on the TS mod.  All can be scrapped, but smaller items may need more than 1 to allow scrapping.  1 sample quest chain is added to show how these items can be used for more than just scrapping.  These items have their own lootgroups, and are added to the vanilla game "Junk" lootgroup for you.  There is also a new lootgroup name "personaljunk" which only contains junk that a dead person might reasonably carry.
