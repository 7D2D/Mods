Mods for the game 7 Days to Die

IMPORTANT! - All mod config files are setup to auto-assign block numbers.  SDX 0.7.1 starts assigning at the first free block AFTER the highest block used.  So in Vanilla, the highest block used is 2041, so these mods will start loading at block ID 2042.  Any block with an ID over 2047 will not appear in game, so it is best if you manually assign ID numbers in the mods config.xml file before building so not to exceed ID 2047.

If you have any questions about these mods, email xyth@xyth.com or ask your questions on out tutorial Q and A site.
